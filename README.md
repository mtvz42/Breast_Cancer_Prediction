# Breast Cancer Prediction
The goal of this notebook is to build several Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a breast tumour is benign or malignant.
The dataset is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahmasleam/breast-cancer?select=breast-cancer.csv
The algorithms tested are:
- Logistic regression
- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision trees
- Random Forest
- Extra trees
- XGBoost

After an initial Exploratory Data Analysis, the models are tested and saved as pickle files. Once performance has been assessed, the predicted data from the best model is analysed.
This notebook is part of the required perr-graded assignment for the Coursera IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate.
