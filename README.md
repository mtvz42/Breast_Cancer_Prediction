# Breast Cancer Prediction
The goal of this notebook is to build several machine learning algorithms to predict whether a breast tumour is benign or malignant.
The dataset is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahmasleam/breast-cancer?select=breast-cancer.csv
The algorithms tested are:
- Logistic regression
- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision trees
- Random Forest
- Extra trees
- XGBoost

After an initial exploratory data analysis, the models are tested and saved as pickle files. After assessing performance, the predicted data from the best model is analysed.
